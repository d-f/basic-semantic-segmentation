Fully convolutional networks are made up entirely of convolutional layers. They generally follow an encoder-decoder structure where the encoder first distills an image down to a set of feature maps like convolutional neural networks with classifiers work. The decoder makes use of deconvolutions (or transpose convolutions) to turn the set of feature maps into a larger segmentation map. The transpose convolution works similarly to a normal convolution, where a small filter with a stride greater than one is convolved across an image to produce a smaller feature map but instead transpose convolutions make use of a fractional stride length, resulting in a larger feature map than the original input.
