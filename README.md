Fully convolutional networks are made up entirely of convolutional layers. They generally follow an encoder-decoder structure where the encoder first distills an image down to a set of feature maps similar to the first section of convolutional neural networks with classifiers. The decoder makes use of deconvolutions (or transpose convolutions) to turn the set of feature maps into a larger segmentation map. The stride length of a convolution determines the amount the filter or kernel moves across the input at a time. Transpose convolutions differ from convolutions in that their stride length is less than one, resulting in a larger output than input.
